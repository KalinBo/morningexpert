## üêû Bug: Temporary Password Accepted at Login but Rejected When Changing Password

### Summary

When a user logs in with a temporary password, authentication succeeds. However, trying to change the password using the same temporary password as the current one results in an error:  
**"Incorrect old password."**

This indicates a mismatch in password validation logic between the login and the change-password form.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to: https://web.morningexpert.com/#  
2. Click **Login**
3. Enter credentials:
   - **Username**: `kalinbobchev@gmail.com`
   - **Password**: `gnBcvT%4ChZJ` (temporary password)
4. Click **Login**
5. Navigate to **Profile** ‚Üí **Change Password**
6. Fill the form:
   - Old password: `gnBcvT%4ChZJ`
   - New password: `4Psdfg()*__ABV`
   - Confirm new password: `4Psdfg()*__ABV`
7. Click **Change**

---

### Expected Behavior

The password should be updated successfully since the old password is valid (used for login moments earlier).

---

### Actual Behavior

An error message is displayed:
> **Current password does not match.**

This prevents the password from being changed, despite being valid during login.

---
